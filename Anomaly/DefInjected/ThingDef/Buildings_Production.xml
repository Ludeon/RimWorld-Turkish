  <!-- EN: When placed near a holding platform, this device draws biomass from the held entity and converts it to bioferrite. The harvester creates more bioferrite than manual extraction.\n\nLarger entities generally produce more bioferrite. However, for most creatures, the process causes extreme discomfort, making the entity harder to contain.\n\nEach holding platform can only support one harvester; however, each harvester can connect to multiple platforms. -->
