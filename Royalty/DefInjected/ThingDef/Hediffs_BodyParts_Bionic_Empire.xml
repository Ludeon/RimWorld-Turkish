  <!-- EN: aesthetic shaper -->
  <AestheticShaper.label>TODO</AestheticShaper.label>
  <!-- EN: A sophisticated package of hormonal and mechanite influences shapes the muscles and fat on the body, adding non-functional aesthetic tissue where needed to achieve a desired appearance. This implant can be configured to form various body shapes according to the user's taste - or that of their partner. -->

  <!-- EN: armorskin gland -->
  <ArmorskinGland.label>TODO</ArmorskinGland.label>
  <!-- EN: This bionic gland releases chemicals and nanomachines that toughen the skin and add flexible subdermal keratin plates at strategic points. This makes the user more resistant to damage across their whole body. Unfortunately, these changes make the skin appear leathery, with wrinkles across the whole body and face, which is generally considered ugly. -->

  <!-- EN: circadian assistant -->
  <CircadianAssistant.label>TODO</CircadianAssistant.label>
  <!-- EN: An artificial gland. Produces chemicals and nanomachines that clear toxin buildup from the brain. -->

  <!-- EN: circadian half-cycler -->
  <CircadianHalfCycler.label>TODO</CircadianHalfCycler.label>
  <!-- EN: A signal redirector which isolates half of the brain, allowing the other half to sleep while the user remains outwardly awake. By alternating brain halves, the user never needs to sleep. Unfortunately, two hemispheres are better than one - working with half a brain causes a reduction in consciousness. -->

  <!-- EN: detoxifier stomach -->
  <DetoxifierStomach.label>TODO</DetoxifierStomach.label>
  <!-- EN: An artificial stomach replacement with a broad-spectrum toxin filter and neutralization system. It allows the user to eat almost anything without ever worrying about food poisoning. -->

  <!-- EN: gastro-analyzer -->
  <GastroAnalyzer.label>TODO</GastroAnalyzer.label>
  <!-- EN: This bionic nose implant enhances the sense of smell, with a focus towards food-related smells. A multi-layered ultrafine absorption mesh detects compounds in the air. A microprocessor formats the readings into an olfactory nerve signal to send to the brain through a nerve-link interface. The result is that the user can smell foods with a depth, richness, and precision unknown among unenhanced humans, allowing them to cook more effectively. The whole unit is small enough to be installed in the nose without affecting the user's appearance. -->

  <!-- EN: healing enhancer -->
  <HealingEnhancer.label>TODO</HealingEnhancer.label>
  <!-- EN: Releases nanomachines and healing factors that speed up wound healing. This implant only helps with physical wounds, and does nothing to combat disease or other health problems. -->

  <!-- EN: immunoenhancer -->
  <Immunoenhancer.label>TODO</Immunoenhancer.label>
  <!-- EN: An analysis computer inspects the bloodstream, classifies pathogens, and rapidly prompts the body's natural immune system to respond to them faster than it could alone. This speeds immunity gain significantly. -->

  <!-- EN: love enhancer -->
  <LoveEnhancer.label>TODO</LoveEnhancer.label>
  <!-- EN: Humans have always tried to use every new technology to enhance sexual satisfaction. Bionics were no exception. This implant makes physical and chemical changes to the body which enhance the experience of lovin' for both partners - both physically and psychologically. The implant unit can adapt to enhance both men and women upon being implanted. -->

  <!-- EN: nuclear stomach -->
  <NuclearStomach.label>TODO</NuclearStomach.label>
  <!-- EN: A micro-nuclear reactor combined with complex chemical synthesis replaces the body's need for food energy. Food is required only to replace matter lost from the body, reducing the user's intake needs significantly. This artificial stomach cannot get food poisoning. However, there is little room to shield the reactor, so the radiation increases the risk of cancer. -->
  <NuclearStomach.description>TODO</NuclearStomach.description>
  
  <!-- EN: reprocessor stomach -->
  <ReprocessorStomach.label>TODO</ReprocessorStomach.label>
  <!-- EN: An advanced chemical processing system breaks down nutrients the body could normally never use, leading to increased efficiency. -->

  <!-- EN: stoneskin gland -->
  <StoneskinGland.label>TODO</StoneskinGland.label>
  <!-- EN: This bionic gland releases chemical and nanomachines that transform the user's skin into a built-in suit of armor. The whole epidermis thickens and hardens to resist burns, while jointed exterior keratin plates form everywhere they can - including the head and face. While it's very difficult to physically hurt someone using this implant, the plates and hard skin significantly reduces the user's physical attractiveness. -->

  <!-- EN: toughskin gland -->
  <ToughskinGland.label>TODO</ToughskinGland.label>
  <!-- EN: This bionic gland releases chemicals and nanomachines that toughen the skin, making it somewhat more resistant to damage. While it doesn't add as much protection as some other skin-hardening glands, the toughskin gland has the advantage of not noticeably altering the user's appearance. -->
