  <!-- EN: An area-denial device which annihilates nearby plants without affecting animals.\n\nIn planetary wars, these weapons are scattered across farmlands or jungles to deny the enemy food or cover. They're usually associated with orbital-drop mechanoid swarms. -->

  <!-- EN: mech node -->
  <Gloomlight.label>TODO</Gloomlight.label>
  <!-- EN: A self-powered mechanoid node of unknown function. Mech nodes can be deconstructed to yield valuable resources - but only if they are captured intact. The internal micro power cell will flame out and ruin the materials if the unit takes too much damage. -->

  <UnstablePowerCell.label>TODO</UnstablePowerCell.label>
  <!-- EN: A mechanoid power generation unit. The vanometric power core will run forever, extracting energy from quantum foam fluctuations.\n\nAn internal amplifier system makes it unstable. If damaged, the unit will generate a massive explosion.\n\nSome brave humans steal these from mechanoids for their own use as power plants or defensive bombs. However, an unintentional detonation can be devastating. -->
